desesc: Dromajo Based ESESC

-Remove most (all?) the const char *str, and use std::string or std::string_view

-Remove most mallocs (string related. any else?)

-Get code style compliant with LiveHD


=Cleanup callback

 The code is based on esesc (C++ from 2000 without lambdas/std::function). Use
 something closer to LiveHD tasks queue syntax.

=Deprecase the pool

 Use new/delete, then valgrind can be used to detect memory leaks (no need for
 in-class check for leaks)
